# E-Commerce-Website
This project is a fully functional e-commerce website built with React, demonstrating my skills in front-end development and state management. It utilizes the Context API for global state management and local storage to maintain user data, integrating seamlessly with the Fake Store API for dynamic product fetching.

# Key features
CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete products. This functionality allows for efficient product management within the application. 
Dynamic Product Listings: The application fetches product data in real-time from the Fake Store API, ensuring that users always see the latest offerings. 
Product Detail View: Each product has a dedicated detail page that provides comprehensive information, including images, descriptions, and pricing. This enhances user engagement and aids in informed purchasing decisions. 
Context API for State Management: Utilized the Context API to manage global application state efficiently. This reduces prop drilling and simplifies data flow throughout the app. Local Storage Integration: Local storage is used to save user preferences and cart items, allowing users to maintain their selections even after refreshing the page.
